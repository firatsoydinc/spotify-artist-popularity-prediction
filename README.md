Artist popularity prediction based on artist song features with using machine learning techniques 

### Introduction

I want to predict the popularity of artists based on song features (energy, instrumentalness, liveness, loudness, speechiness, tempo, popularity, album, name). 

***
**Context**: Spotify is an audio streaming and media services provider. In 2019 there were approximately 40,000 new songs uploaded everyday. Nowadays, artists rely a lot on Spotify to earn money, simply selling hard copied albums will not suffice for them. Artists on Spotify get paid every time their song is streamed (Vultaggio, 2021). Moreover, artists are given the opportunity to find new fans in countries where their music may not be sold (Coffey, 2016), and thus increasing their reach and popularity. Spotify has the Topsify tab on the 'Home' page which shows daily popular albums, artists, songs. Topsify is based on artist and song popularity and in terms of design it is the most visible tab from the 'Home' page. Because of that, users tend to listen to those songs and therefore increase their popularity. The design is reachable and easy to use for all users. 


**Research question**: How popular are artists in the 2018-2021 range based on song features?


**Practical relevance**: Even though Spotify has the Topsify tab, I want predict the popularity of all artist from the above-mentioned years range. 
Why do I want to predict this? Artists might want their songs to reach the Topsify tab and this model could be helpful for artists to compose more popular songs based on song features and increase their reach and therefore become more popular.
